### How to run the development server.

Clone the repo using ```git clone https://github.com/RoelMK/DBLWeb24.git```. Enter the directory with ```cd DBLWeb24```, and then run the development server using ```php -S localhost:8000```. You can now view the site in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000.

_Make sure you have php installed. If you can't access it from the command line, add the installation folder to your PATH environment variable._
